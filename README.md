# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Nikol Kovacevic**

Time spent: **7** 

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/translucent-mirage-century

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [x ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
- Provide game status (if currently playing or i the game was won or lost).

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used W3Schools to help me complete my submission.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge I encountered in creating my submission was coding in the three different languages – JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I had not coded in any of them recently, so I was not sure of the rules of the syntax. I overcame it by looking at the other examples in the code as I followed along in the instructions. I also looked at W3Schools to remind me of some concepts, such as adding an element into an array within javascript. Some of the optional implementations required even more researching to understand how exactly to implement a feature, such as adding a timer. An added challenge with these additions, was ensuring that all properties– html, css, and javascript – if needed dealt with this new addition. I really liked using Glitch and the fact that I did not have to install a new software, but I faced some problems when my WIFi had limited connectivity. This loss of connection made me worried that I would lose my recent progress, but the problem was able to resolve itself. Another challenge I encountered was I faced some security software blocking some elements of the page, and in addition sending error messages such as “”Cross-Origin Request Blocked” which I overcame by disabling it. 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After completing my submission, I wonder how certain implementations of websites could lead to them being more or less accessible to certain individuals. I believe that there are programs that can read components of the page to individuals who would not have as easy access to the website otherwise. I wonder how formating/layout would play into these programs. Another question I had about web development was how exactly do the sites get developed and published? How long did development of these sites take, such as gmail. There are certain websites that I think of that are not very accessible and clear and I wonder if they undergo testing and receive thorough feedback before these sites get published? Another question I had regarding web development is how do cookies work in tracking our movements from site to site. Lastly, I wondered how exactly script blockers work and how they get implemented within web development in the first place.


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would want to create levels that are increasingly challenging, and the user would be able to pick which level they want to play. The difficulty could be affected by the amount of squares visible, or the speed at which the game is played. Another possibility could be that the length of the initial sequence provided could change, instead of introducing one more aspect of the sequence at a time, more chunks could be introduced at a time. A feature similar to levels could be themes, such as genres of music, so the sounds could be either snippets of a song, or certain instrumentations that are generally found within a genre. By the end the song is almost a composition and the layout of the page would be related to the theme. I think an interesting aspect could also be to occasionally mix up the order of the buttons in between the new clue being given. The user would need to remember the specific color of the square played and not just finding a pattern of pushing the buttons. I believe this addition would be extra challenging if when a new clue was given the clues prior were not repeated. 
To make the game more competitive, I could keep track of the scores, so the player could have a high score. Another feature I would like to add is having the ability to have the game be multiplayer, where the sequence is determined by the opposing player – they add on a square, then you do, then they do to the pattern, and the process continues.
